# ó°²… FUSE
## FUSE - FUSE Unifies System Essentials
FUSE was designed to make my workflow with the [Niri](https://github.com/yalter/niri) WM more streamlined and efficient. It was inspired by a multi modal workflow, uniting an application launcher, a dashboard, and a window switcher. Additionally it includes a system bar. The main goal was simplicity and minimalism, which is accomplished by only relying on a terminal emulator to work.

## Features:
 - Fuzzy finding applications and launching them
 - Customization of dashboard commands, like network management, bluetooth, or a system monitor. Anything goes that has a shell or a TUI
 - Status in the launcher instead of a seperate bar, (eg: volume, battery, backlight or keyboard language)
 - Window switching in niri
 - Custom tools for managing Bluetooth and WiFi connections is included. The fit the theme and style of FUSE. The can be started by starting the respective files in the modules directory.

## Requirements:
 - niri, window switching and keyboard language display depend on the niri compositor and use `niri msg`
 - alacritty, alacritty is used as the terminal emulator and is started by `start.py` with the launcher running (you _could_ use another terminal emulator, but you will need to change `start.py`)
 - pactl, for displaying the volume
 - python-psutil, for showing battery information in the header bar
 - fzf, for the whole program to even work
 - nerdfont, to display the icons in the status bar correctly
 - fish, this is the shell for which this was written. it is probably possible to port to other shells, but I did not have the time up until now.

## How to use:
 -  Add the following rule to your niri config file:
	```
	window-rule {
		match title="fuse"
		open-focused true
		open-floating true
	}
	```
 - Add a binding somewhere in your niri config to start the `python start.py`
 - Customize the entries in your dashboard using ~/.config/launcher.json it should look this way:
 ```
 [
 	{
  	"name": "name of the entry",
    "exec": "command to execute"
  }
 ]
 ```
 - The launcher starts in normal mode. You can switch to dashboard mode by selecting the entry `:d`, using `:w` will switch you to window mode
 - In any mode you can exit the launcher `:q` or return to normal mode with `:n`.
 - Pressing Esc selecting a entry in normal or window mode or defocusing the window will close it

## How it works
 - In normal mode .desktop files will be parsed from all of the usual locations, their name will be displayed, when selected the binary defined in their Exec field will be executed
 - In window mode the launcher will get all open windows using `niri msg windows` and will switch to the selected one with `niri msg action focus-window --id <id>`
 - In dashboard mode your entries will be parsed and the `exec` field of the selected one will be executed. You should either use a TUI or a shell in your exec field.

## Installation
On most distros you will be able to use the launcher by just cloning the repo and then running the `start.py` file

On NixOS this should work too, but you can also use home-manager. You can just import the two files into home-manager. You can configure the dashboard using `launcher.nix`, a few entries will already be included by default. Then just rebuild your home. A flake will follow soon.

## Future Goals
I would like to make this project as hackable as possible, the goal is to make every aspect of the launcher customizable. For now the only options are to customize which apps appear, with which PATH they are launched and, what dashboard options are available (the PATH is customizable for these too). More documentation on these options will follow soon.
